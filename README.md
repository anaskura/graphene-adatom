Code to reproduce the results of the paper "Flat bands with fragile topology through superlattice engineering on single-layer graphene"
A. Skurativska et.al, Phys. Rev. Research 3, L032003 (2021).

This code

• generates a tight-binding model and a band structure of a system of graphene with periodically distributed adatoms on top;

• analyzes the symmetry eigenvalues of the bands at high-symmetry points;

• generates the OBC spectrum for the flake and ribbon geometries;

• visualizes the corner states found in the lattice geometry.
