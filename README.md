# Graphene-adatom
Scripts for reproducing Graphene-adatom paper results

Codes:

• to generate unit cell, tight-binding model and energy bands for PBC

• to analyze the symmetry eigenvalues of the bands

• to generate graphene spectrum for OBC graphene flake and ribbon geometry and get corner states

• to visualize corner states and check thermodynamic limit

• explain filling anomaly with double Haldane model
